\section{Pict2Text version 1}
As described previously ``Pict2Text'' version 1 is the initial state and the base of our project. The first version of this project is a web application which permits the translation of pictograms to natural language- spanish. 

Using the user interface we can write and search a specific word from the ARASAAC pictogram database and display it into the pictogram container of the right part of the web page.
